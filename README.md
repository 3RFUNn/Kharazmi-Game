# Kharazmi Game (بازی خوارزمی)


## Overview
Kharazmi Game is an educational mathematics game designed to make learning algebraic expressions fun and engaging. Players assume the role of a mathematician collecting "Kharazmi badges" by solving various mathematical challenges across three distinct game stages.

## Game Description
In this game, you are a clever and curious mathematician who loves solving mathematical problems and wants to earn Kharazmi badges. Using your knowledge and skills in algebraic expressions, you must solve different challenges and collect the maximum number of Kharazmi badges.

## Game Stages

### Stage 1: Hunting Algebraic Expressions (Snake Game)
In this stage, a mischievous snake hunts for similar algebraic expressions. You must guide it to eat as many matching algebraic expressions as possible. Each correct expression the snake eats gives you extra time (5 seconds per matching expression) to solve problems in the next stages.

### Stage 2: Battle with Equations
Now it's time to solve algebraic equations! By solving each equation, you earn more time to use in the next stage. The faster and more accurately you solve the equations, the higher your score. Each correct answer grants you an additional 10 seconds.

### Stage 3: Raining Algebraic Expressions
The mathematics sky opens up, and algebraic expressions rain down! You must carefully collect the raindrops and arrange them to create the requested algebraic expressions. Each correct expression you form earns you a Kharazmi badge. Be quick, as the raindrops rapidly disappear!

## Game Objective
Collect 5 Kharazmi badges to win the game and become a math champion!
